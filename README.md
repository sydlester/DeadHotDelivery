## Game Pitch

Welcome to the zombie apocalypse! You are playing an Davis, an extremely committed pizza delivery boy with a history of outstanding service in the suburbs of North Carolina. Even though zombies have taken over, Davis is not going to let a few zombies get in the way of his 5-star review on Yelp. Start off in the pizza shop, collecting pizzas to complete orders, then venture out into the apocalyptic world to deliver the pizzas to customers. With your trusted knife, and any weapons you find along the way, you must defeat any zombies that block your way to deliver your pizzas as fast as possible. Your customers are counting on you. 

## How to Play

**Level 1: Pizza Shop**
- Movement: Use left, right, up, down keys or a,s,d,w keys to move across the map
- Follow the prompt on the screen to collect the correct pizzas for your order. Press the "E" key to pick up the correct pizzas
- Once you have collected the pizzas, exit the pizza shop

**Level 2: Delivery!** 
- Use the same movement keys to traverse the map
- You will be prompted with an address to deliver the pizza to, including street name and house number. Press the "M" key to toggle a mini map to help guide you through the streets
- You are given a knife to defend yourself against the zombies. Use "Q" to attack the zombies. They will be highlighted in yellow when they are in range for your attack
- If you find any other weapons on the street, press "E" to equip the weapon. These weapons may increase your range of attack and damage
- When you get to the correct house, press the "R" key to deliver the pizza order. After, follow the prompts from the game and return to the pizza shop 
- Once you have completed 3 successful pizza pick-ups and deliveries, you win the game! However, if you take too much damage from zombie attacks, you will lose, and you must start your delivery quest from the beginning.


## Content Available

In the pizza shop there are multiple features to create an engaging and memorable game. For starters, there is a background audio and artistic homescreen to welcome players to the game. Then, players are greeted with a different audio once they start the pizza shop level. Players receive directions through prompts from the game on what actions they need to pursue. In the lower center of the screen, players have an inventory box, where they can see the pizzas they have collected. There is another audio to let players know they have collected the correct pizzas for their order

Once players enter the delivery level, they are met with different elements. Across the map, there are zombies, which use game AI to move towards the players location and attack them if they are near enough. These zombie movements are accompanied by zombie noises to alert players that zombies are near. Players can use a knife they are given to attack these zombies. If they find a better weapon around the map, such as a sword, they can equip that weapond and use it to fight zombies. To help players know when they are in range to pick up a weapon, the weapon will be highlighted in yellow and a prompt to equip it will pop up for players. The same is true for zombies, where if they are close enough to the player, the zombie will be highlighted in yellow and the player will be prompted to attack. The level includes audios for when players successfully hit a zombie, as well as a sound effect and knockback effect when players get hit. To navigate the streets, players have access to a mini-map, which includes street names and house numbers. At the beginning of the level, players are prompted with an address to deliver the pizza. They can toggle the mini-map to direct themselves to the correct house and deliver the pizza. 

If a player successfully completes three pizza deliveries, they win the game and are transitioned to a win screen, with a celebratory audio, and a prompt to play the game again. However, if the player takes too much damage from the zombies, they will die, and receive a death screen, as well as a prompt to start the game over. 

## Lessons Learned

1. Communication is Key: We divided up many tasks throughout this project, so it was important for us to communicate what we were working on, as well as when we pushed/merged any changes to the game. This communication helped prevent any major conflicts or errors, as well as making sure we all stayed informed about how the game was progressing, and what future directions we should pursue. 

2. Collaboration Can Be Difficult in Unity : We each took different scenes and features to implement in the game. However, we quickly found out that multiple people working on the same scene across different computers led to a range of errors on Unity. To solve this, we quickly adapted, and made sure we communicated what scenes we were working on, as well as working in copies of scenes if more than one person was working on a scene at the same time 

3. Every Feature May Not Work Out, and That is Okay: When we first planned out our game, we had a range of different ideas for features we could implement in the game. However, once we started the design/coding process, some features were much more difficult to implement than others. When this happened, we adapted, and discussed how we could change features or add in different features to improve upon our current iteration of the game. 

4. Playtesting is Key: The most important thing we did was consistently test the features of our game, both on their own, and together. This helped us pinpoint issues in our code and in the Unity settings. Along with the playtesting session in class, this approach helped us improve our game, and even gave us the idea to implement new features when there were sections of the game that seemed too difficult/confusing.
