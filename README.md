## Game Pitch

A brief, 2-3 sentence description of your game (you can reuse text from previous assignments).

You are a pizza delivery boy in the apocalypse. You must pick up orders from the pizza shop and deliver them to the correct house, without being eaten by zombies. You can fight off zombies using a knife, or weapons you find along the way. The goal is to complete all of the orders as fast as possible.

## How to Play

Use arrow keys to move, "e" to pick up, "r" to drop off, and "q" to hit zombies. Once you pick up the correct pizzas in the kitchen, exit the shop to the left to enter the streets. From there, find the correct street and house displayed, and deliver the pizza to the listed house.
